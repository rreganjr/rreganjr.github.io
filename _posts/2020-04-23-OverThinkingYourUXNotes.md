## Notes on Why You're Over-Thinking Your UI/UX with Rohan Puri | Harvard i-lab

from Youtube.com [Why You're Over-Thinking Your UI/UX with Rohan Puri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is2O666qDPs)

### Narrow Your Scope

* very narrow band of target users, first-adopters, very specific
(mom's 40-50 in california who earn 100K+)
* speeds up development time - only focus on statisfying that user's need
* guide testing
* identify marketing
* narrows number of variables for testing


examples:

Amazon -> started with just new books

Google -> search

Twitter -> sms platform to put a message on a screen

kill it with that one thing first

template:

______________ is a ______________________ that allows __________________ to _______________

(product) is a (general, relatable tool) that allows (2 adjectives + target users) to (use-case)

general, relatable tool -> we are the "uber" for what ever

2 adjectives -> super specific not "very"

### Define Personas

take target users and put a name and context to it. don't go crazy with it, you don't need a full page.

[me: anti-persona - someone that isn't a target user]

h2. Check yourself -> Sory board

[checkout ios storyboard feature]

* use personas
* identify and cut long trees/branches (deep UI workflows)
* identify dead ends

### Stop

stop thinking, no more mockups, personas, interviews, start building


### Build

* html
* 99 designs (don't spend lots of time on logos and name)
* keynotopia - package of buttons/menus built in keynote and power point to build a slide show
** balsamic 

#### Distribute

* test flight (ios testing)
* heroku
* hockey app

#### Collect Data 
_be very quantitative_

* heap - collects data on everything
* google analytics - you must be very specific
* flurry
(
* mail chimp
* hubspot
)


### Simplify

anyone can make something bigger and more complex

expose users to feature, look at data, simplify, remove things that aren't used/useful.

Prioritize activity Pathways

* what pathway do you need users to engage with the most?
* What pathway do users use the most?

create/browse/respond

Focus Above the fold - user's don't scroll
