### What Users Really Want Versus What Gets Delivered

I find requirements the hard part of software development because communication is so hard; much harder than it seems it should be.

1. What the user really wants.
1. What the user thinks they want.
1. What the user asks for.
1. How I interpret what the user asks for.
1. What I conceptualize that meets my interpretation of what the user wants.
    * Mapping my understanding of the requirements to an abstract solution that I think will meet the requirements.
1. What I deliver

In a perfect world "what I deliver" equals "what the user really wants". In the real world what I deliver is close to what I think was requested. 


#### Language and Understanding

* Sometimes a word or statement means different things to different people.
* Sometimes people don't say what they mean, using the wrong word or combination of words.
* Sometimes people mishear or misinterpret what someone else says.

I worked on a project where my interpretation of the ask was for an international site and a domestic site, and I'm pretty sure it was discussed as the international site should do this and the domestic should do that. We had two different domains. Within a month of the go live date during a demo talking about redirecting users from the domestic site to the international based on registratoin country I was told there should be only one site that shows users different content for domestic versus international based on the registration information.

#### Details

Software is effectively unconstrained with respect to options. Because of this a lot of detail is required to produce it.
