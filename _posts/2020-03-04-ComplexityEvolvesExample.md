### Example of How Complexity Increases as a Feature Evolves

video data import

missing video data for users that aren't in our system

missing video data when we remap between ours and their events

dynamically organize event data at report time

if a user changes their email address we still need to be able to map the data with the old email address from video data to our system

reporting only users that become "real" users

merging two users together - some of our partners send generated email addresses in place of real emails in urls to our events, later they will send us a mapping of generated to real user emails and data that we use to collect the users use of our system so we can accurately report unique users.
